# GUS API Testing - Status Update

## Current Issue: 415 Unsupported Media Type

The backend is getting a **415 error** when trying to login to the GUS API, which suggests:

1. **SOAP Format Issue**: The GUS production server might expect a slightly different SOAP envelope format
2. **API Key Issue**: The production API key might be invalid or expired
3. **Server Issue**: GUS production servers might be experiencing issues

## Testing Steps Completed:

‚úÖ **Validation Working**: Both NIP `5252630714` and REGON `362594418` pass validation  
‚úÖ **Backend Updated**: Fixed SOAP envelope format to match GUS documentation  
‚úÖ **Configuration**: Production mode with API key configured  
‚ùå **GUS Login**: Getting 415 error during SOAP login request  

## Next Steps:

### Option 1: Test with Direct SOAP Call
Use the `postman-gus-direct-api.json` collection to test the official GUS API directly and see if:
- The test environment works
- The production environment works with our API key
- What the exact SOAP format should be

### Option 2: Switch to Test Mode Temporarily
Set `GUS_USE_TEST=true` to use the test environment and verify our implementation works.

### Option 3: Debug SOAP Format
The 415 error suggests the Content-Type or SOAP envelope isn't exactly what GUS expects.

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Postman collection updated with correct test data
- ‚úÖ Backend deployed with improved SOAP format
- ‚ùå Still getting 415 error on GUS login
- üîÑ Ready for direct GUS API testing to identify the root cause

## Recommendation:
Let's use the direct GUS API Postman collection to understand what format works, then adjust our backend implementation accordingly.
